"""
In its simplest definition, point density describes the number of points in a given area.
Commonly the point density is given for one square meter and therefore uses the unit pts/mÂ².
Point spacing on the other hand is defined as the distance between two adjacent points.

CLOUD COMPARE: Two methods can be used to compute the density:
either 'Precise': the density is estimated by counting for each point the number of neighbors N
or 'Approximate': the density is simply estimated by determining the distance to the nearest neighbor
(which is generally much faster). This distance is considered as being equivalent to the above spherical
neighborhood radius R (and N = 1).
